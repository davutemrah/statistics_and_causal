## Transformations

### Log transformation

• To correct for right skewness
• When considering ratios
• In settings where errors are feasibly multiplicative, such as when dealing with concentrations or rates
• To consider orders of magnitude (using log base 10); for example, when considering astronomical distances
• Counts are often logged (though note the problem with zero counts). Income variable is generally log-transformed.
